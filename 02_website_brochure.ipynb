      "Anthropic is an AI safety and research company. We build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.\n",
      "Join us\n",
      "Our Purpose\n",
      "We believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.\n",
      "We Build Safer Systems\n",
      "We aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\n",
      "Safety Is a Science\n",
      "We treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\n",
      "Interdisciplinary\n",
      "Anthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\n",
      "AI Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\n",
      "AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\n",
      "The Team\n",
      "We’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "We conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\n",
      "Policy\n",
      "We think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\n",
      "Product\n",
      "We translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\n",
      "Operations\n",
      "Our people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\n",
      "Our Values\n",
      "01\n",
      "Here for the mission\n",
      "Anthropic exists for our mission: to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish. Progress this decade may be rapid, and we expect increasingly capable systems to pose novel challenges. We pursue our mission by building frontier systems, studying their behaviors, working to responsibly deploy them, and regularly sharing our safety insights. We collaborate with other projects and stakeholders seeking a similar outcome.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Unusually high trust\n",
      "Our company is an unusually high trust environment: we assume good faith, disagree kindly, and prioritize honesty. We expect emotional maturity and intellectual openness. At its best, our trust enables us to make better decisions as an organization than any one of us could as individuals.\n",
      "03\n",
      "One big team\n",
      "Collaboration is central to our work, culture, and value proposition. While we have many teams at Anthropic, we feel the broader sense in which we are all on the same team working together towards the mission. Leadership sets the strategy, with broad input from everyone, and trusts each piece of the organization to pursue these goals in their unique style. Individuals commonly contribute to work across many different areas.\n",
      "04\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works\n",
      "We celebrate trying the simple thing before the clever, novel thing. We embrace pragmatism - sensible, practical approaches that acknowledge tradeoffs. We love empiricism - finding out what actually works by trying it - and apply this to our research, our engineering and our collaboration. We aim to be open about what we understand and what we don’t.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Anthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation, whose purpose is the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity. Our Board of Directors is elected by stockholders and our Long-Term Benefit Trust, as explained\n",

      "The interview process at Anthropic varies based on role and candidate, but our standard process looks like this:\n",
      "Step 1\n",
      "Resume\n",
      "Submit your resume via our website.\n",
      "Step 2\n",
      "Exploratory chat\n",
      "You’ll have a chat with one of our staff to discuss your career interests and relevant experience, and learn more about Anthropic.\n",
      "Step 3\n",
      "Skills Assessment\n",
      "For technical roles, you’ll have a one-hour technical screening interview.\n",
      "For operations or policy roles, you’ll get a take-home assignment. These typically involve writing responses to several role-relevant questions; they may occasionally require some outside research. Assignments usually take between 2-5 hours, depending on the role.\n",
      "We include this to minimize bias and make well-informed hiring decisions. We think seeing a candidate’s work helps us assess how they might actually perform on the job; similarly, the assignment gives candidates a better idea of what their work at Anthropic might entail. If a candidate likes working through their take-home, that is one indicator that they would enjoy taking on the role, and vice versa.\n",
      "We recognize that completing work assignments requires time and effort, and that they are not perfectly reflective of the role’s work. Nonetheless, we think that work tests are a useful complement to interviews and reference checks.\n",
      "Step 4\n",
      "Team Screen\n",
      "You'll have a conversation with either the Hiring Manager or a member of your potential team.\n",
      "Step 5\n",
      "Interview Panel\n",
      "For technical roles, you’ll have 3-4 more one-hour technical interviews, plus a culture interview.\n",
      "For operations or policy roles, you’ll have 3-5 hours of interviews, including a culture interview.\n",
      "Step 6\n",
      "Final Checks\n",
      "We’ll ask for some references, and have you chat with our leadership.\n",
      "Step 7\n",
      "Offer\n",
      "We’ll make you an offer!\n",
      "Technical Interviews\n",
      "Technical interviews at Anthropic are broadly categorized into ‘engineering’ or ‘research’ interviews, and each candidate is given a mix tailored to their skillset.\n",
      "Engineering interviews are usually carried out in a shared Python coding environment, like Google Colab. Frontend engineering interviews are in JavaScript. They have the form:\n",
      "Here’s a description of a component from our stack. Could you re-implement a toy version of it for me in one hour?\n",
      "These components are ‘chunkier’ than the more common LeetCode problems, and are intended to mimic the day-to-day of engineering at Anthropic.\n",
      "We are particularly interested in your thought process and how you attack the problem. You’ll be allowed to look things up with Google, but it’s still important to be familiar with Python syntax and the standard library. We primarily code in Python, and a common reason candidates fail interviews is that they're not fully comfortable in Python.\n",
      "Only one of our engineering interviews touches on machine learning topics, and you can ask to pass on that one if you wish. You do not need to learn anything about machine learning before interviewing as an engineer at Anthropic.\n",
      "Research interviews are broader in form. They’ll include some engineering interviews, and some discussions about the kinds of systems we study.\n",
      "Both the research and engineering interview process also include softer questions about your experience and motivations, and time to ask us about Anthropic.\n",
      "Other Things\n",
      "Engineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering\n",
      "While there’s historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.\n",
      "If you’ve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. You’ll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join you’ll have as much input to Anthropic’s direction and interests as anyone else.\n",
      "As evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title - ‘Member of Technical Staff’.\n",
      "We value direct evidence of ability\n",
      "If you’ve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.\n",
      "Visas\n",
      "Anthropic sponsors visas! We aren't able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n",
      "Green cards\n",
      "Once you’re eligible, we’re also keen to sponsor green cards!\n",
      "We do not require PhDs, degrees, or previous ML experience\n",
      "About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.\n",
      "Remote interviewing\n",
      "All our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if that’s difficult for you.\n",
      "Re-applying\n",
      "Similarly, if interviews don’t work out this time, you’re welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.\n",
      "Remote work\n",
      "Anthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.\n",
      "Offer timing\n",
      "If we make an offer, we’re happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes you’re going through.\n",
      "Internships\n",
      "We do not offer internships.\n",
